    <h1>We are blessed and lucky to have such a fantastic and loving Mom/Wife/Grandmother</h1>
    <p>Mom, you are such an amazing, thoughtful, and caring person. In all the time I  have spent on this Earth, I have never felt anything but love from you. I still think about:
        <ul>
            <li>The times you'd wait with me for the school bus at the apartments in Centralia.</li>
            <li>Vacations, especially the one to Winthrop. There was that one time when, and I still feel like us kids were pretty mean, you took us to the rest stop and wanted us to camp out there. </li>
        </ul> </p>
